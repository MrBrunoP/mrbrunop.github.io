                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">It's not every day you pick up a shoe that defines your return to running. After a 10-year break, the Nike Pegasus Trail 4 was that shoe for me. It was a "do-it-all" choice for my Couch to 5K program, and I hoped it would handle everything from my local gravel paths to actual trail walks. I've now put over 470 kilometers on them, and they've been an interesting and ultimately very durable companion.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">Fit & Comfort: My Foot's Journey with the Shoe.</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Initially, the shoe felt a bit snug on the sides, but as I wore them, they seemed to mold to my foot and the discomfort went away. I found them to be true to size for my feet (EUR 42, 26.5 cm).</p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">However, as I started to run longer—pushing past 10K—I noticed some issues. My toes would start to hurt, leading to blisters and even the dreaded black toenails after my longest runs. This was a particularly frustrating problem, especially considering I could run much longer distances in my Novablast 4 (also a size 42) without any toe issues. It seems that while the shoe felt fine for shorter, slower efforts, for me, the fit was not ideal when my feet started to swell during longer distances and on downhills.</p>

            <section class="mb-8">
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">The Ride: From the Sidewalks to the Trails.</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The ride of this shoe is best described as a <span class="firm-text">firm</span> and reliable. It's a solid workhorse for daily training and provided me with the confidence to progress from a 9-minute/km pace down to a 5-minute/km pace. The shoe felt consistent and protective on the various surfaces I ran on, from smooth sidewalks to the "gravel-like dirt" you described.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The durability of the outsole has been exceptional. Even after 470 kilometers, the tread looks almost new, which is a testament to the quality of the rubber. I also wore them for my first official trail race, the Sabrosa Trail por Terras de Magalhães. They performed well on the initial parts of the course, but on the technical downhills, my feet would slide forward, causing my toes to jam into the front of the shoe. This made it difficult to run fast on the descents and led to some blisters and black nails by the end. This experience confirmed my suspicion that for a long, technical trail run, the fit wasn't quite right for me.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">Final Verdict: Who is this shoe for?</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The Nike Pegasus Trail 4 is a great entry point for a new runner or for someone looking for a versatile shoe to handle a mix of sidewalks, gravel, and light trails. Its durability and solid ride make it a reliable daily trainer.</p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Based on my experience, if you're planning to tackle longer distances (10K+) or more technical trails with significant downhills, you might want to consider going up half a size or looking for a shoe with a more secure and protected toe box. Ultimately, I ended up selling them to support a 'Buy EU' movement, but not for any lack of performance.</p>
