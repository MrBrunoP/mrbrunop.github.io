                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">Introduction & First Impressions</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">After starting to consistently run under a 6-minute kilometer pace, I was ready for a new tool to help me get even faster. That's when I picked up the Nike ZoomX Streakfly. The moment I held them, I was struck by how incredibly <span class="light-text">light</span> they were—each shoe weighed just under 200 grams. I loved them at the beginning; they felt fast and responsive, exactly what I thought I needed for shorter, quicker runs.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">Fit & Comfort: A Race-Day Lockdown</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">On paper, the sizing was perfect for me at EUR 42 (26.5 cm), the same as my other shoes like the Novablast 4 and Pegasus Trail 4. However, the experience was completely different. The Streakfly was way too snug, and after just 5K, I would get blisters. This is a common issue with racing shoes; they are designed for a super tight, secure fit to prevent any foot movement at high speeds. While this works for some, for me, and especially on longer runs, it was unforgiving and caused a lot of pain as my feet started to swell.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">The Ride: Ground Feel & Bottoming Out</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The ride was fast, no doubt, but the cushioning wasn't what I expected. The shoe uses ZoomX foam, which is known for being soft and bouncy. However, due to the low stack height and the shoe's design, I found myself "bottoming out" the cushioning after only about 3K. This is a sensation where the foam compresses completely and you can feel the hard ground beneath it. As someone who was still on a weight-loss journey and weighed around 78kg at the time, the limited cushioning was simply not enough for my frame. This shoe is built for a specific kind of runner and a specific kind of pace, and it became clear to me that it wasn't the right tool for me.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">Durability: Not for Sidewalks</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">I ended up running just 95 kilometers in them before I decided to sell them. The outsole was already showing signs of significant wear, with parts falling apart. While this was disappointing, it's a known trade-off for this type of shoe. The outsole has minimal rubber to keep the weight down, and it's not designed to handle the abrasive nature of sidewalks and roads for extended periods. It's truly a shoe meant for a specific use case, like a smooth track or a race course.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">Final Verdict: A Specialist's Shoe</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The Nike ZoomX Streakfly is a specialized tool, not a daily workhorse. It’s perfect for a lightweight, advanced runner who needs a shoe for specific track workouts or 5K/10K races. For me, it was a valuable lesson in what to look for in a shoe. My experience of feeling like I was bottoming out and the issues with blisters are very common for runners who are not a perfect match for this shoe's design. It's a shoe that gives you a lot of ground feel, which is great for some but not for everyone.</p>
