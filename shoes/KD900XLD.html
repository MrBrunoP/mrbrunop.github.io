                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The journey from C25K to a half-marathon is a big one, and choosing the right shoe is a crucial part of that. When I picked up the Kiprun KD900X LD, I was looking for a budget-friendly way to step into the world of carbon-plated shoes, hoping it would be the tool to get me to the finish line. My experience with them was a story of happy surprises and hard lessons, one that's a bit more complicated than just hitting a fast pace.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-8 mb-4 font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl text-zinc-900">Fit & Sizing: The Long and Wobbly Road</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Like many people, I thought my standard <strong>EUR 42 (26.5 cm)</strong> would be the perfect fit, especially since the size guide suggested it was within range. The shoe did feel fast, but also a bit "weird," which is a common sensation with carbon-plated shoes if you're not used to them. They require a specific kind of running form and pace to feel truly propulsive, and it's okay to admit you might not be there yet—it's part of the learning process.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">First impressions were also impacted by the sheer difficulty of putting them on. The tongue is designed in a way that it constantly folds and dangles, making it a struggle to get your foot in. Once they were on, they felt snug on the sides, but the toe box felt long. I figured this extra space was a good thing, especially since runners often go up a half size for longer distances to accommodate foot swelling. What became clear over time is that this shoe runs long, and the ample toe room, combined with the firm ride, led to discomfort and blistering later on.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">The Half Marathon Experience: A Tale of Two Races</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">My first half-marathon in the shoes was a success in terms of the goal, but a painful experience for my feet. I finished with a pace of <strong>6:17/km</strong> over a hilly course with an elevation of <strong>264 m</strong>. The black nails and blisters were a result of the ill-fitting upper. It's easy to blame the shoe for this, but as my second race proved, the shoe was only part of the equation.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">A month later, I tackled a flatter course, the <strong>Meia Maratona do Douro Vinhateiro</strong>, with only <strong>75 m</strong> of elevation. Despite the hot weather and a slower pace of <strong>6:26/km</strong>, my feet and legs felt surprisingly good. This showed me that the initial half-marathon's brutal elevation had likely put far more strain on my body than I realised, with the shoe's unforgiving nature simply highlighting the stress. This is a crucial distinction: the KD900X LD is a tool for a strong runner. The shoe's lower 4mm drop (less than many competitors) and firm ride means your calves and legs have to work harder, which can lead to that "dead leg" feeling.</p>

                            <ul class="space-y-2 text-zinc-700">
                                <li><strong>Value:</strong> At a fraction of the cost of its competitors, it offers a real carbon-plate experience.</li>
                                <li><strong>Improved Ride:</strong> The VFOAM PLUS midsole is a big step up, providing more energy return and a bouncier feel than the previous model.</li>
                                <li><strong>Durability:</strong> The shoe is built to last. With 115 km on them, they showed minimal signs of wear and are praised in reviews for their longevity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fast Paces:</strong> They felt truly responsive at faster paces, leading to a significant PB on my third half-marathon, improving from a **6:17/km** to a **5:49/km** over a year.</li>

                            <ul class="space-y-2 text-zinc-700">
                                <li><strong>Sizing:</strong> The shoe runs long. My standard **EUR 42 (26.5 cm)** felt like it had too much toe room, which contributed to discomfort and blistering, despite being snug on the sides.</li>
                                <li><strong>Difficult Entry:</strong> The tongue is a hassle to deal with. It tends to fold and bunch up, making the shoe very difficult to put on. The laces are also just barely long enough for a secure runner's knot.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lack of Cushioning:</strong> For a runner like myself, the shoes felt like they "bottomed out" in the last 7-10 km of a half-marathon, especially on my third race over a hilly **252 m** elevation course.</li>
                                <li><strong>Demanding Ride:</strong> The low **4mm drop** and firm ride require a strong running form and pace. This can lead to very "dead legs," especially if you are not accustomed to the demands of such a shoe.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-zinc-900">Final Verdict: A Specialist's Shoe</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">My third half-marathon showed the shoe's true potential. I'd been doing more speed work and had a year of running under my belt, and the shoe responded in kind with a significantly faster pace of <strong>5:49/km</strong> over a course with a similar elevation of <strong>252 m</strong>. However, the feeling of "bottoming out" in the last 7-10 kilometres is a common complaint. While the VFOAM PLUS is a huge improvement over its predecessor, it is not as plush as some premium race shoes and simply does not have the same level of cushioning for sustained efforts, especially for runners who need a bit more support. The carbon plate, while present, feels more like a stabiliser than a springboard, which might explain why it felt "off" when my form started to break down from fatigue.</p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">The <strong>115 kilometres</strong> I put on the shoes before moving on is a solid amount of mileage for a carbon-plated shoe. The durability of the Kiprun is one of its most praised features, often outlasting more expensive competitors. In the end, this shoe is a fantastic budget option for a half-marathon, but it's not a magic bullet. It requires a lot from the runner, and it's best suited for those who have developed the strength and form to get the most out of its firm, propulsive ride.</p>
